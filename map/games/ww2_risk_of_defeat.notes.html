<b>How to Play</b><br>
"RISK of Defeat" plays similarly to the classic strategy board-game RISK. At the beginning of the game, you chose which territories start under your control in a turn-based fashion.<br>
As the game progresses, you gain more troops to place onto the map in order to conquer more territory. When you conquer more territory, you can place even more troops to conquer even more territory, and so on.<br>
This cycle of play continues until one person (or one team/alliance) is declared the winner by controlling the eniter board.<br>
<br>
However, things get more complicated in this TripleA rendition of RISK. In normal RISK, you simply have "armies" and nothing else to worry about.<br>
In "Risk of Defeat", you must balance income (known as PU or "Production Units"), infrastructure, and military composition (Land, Air, and Sea).<br>
In addition, there are certain restrictions (and exceptions to restrictions) to where you can and can't move units, place new units, and so on.<br>
A link to a PDF file will be included in upcoming version which breaks down how every mechanic works in "RISK of Defeat".<br>
